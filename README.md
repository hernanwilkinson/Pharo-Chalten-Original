# Pharo-Chalten-Original
This is the Pharo version of the "Original" Chalten.

Chalten was first implemented by me (Hern√°n Wilkinson) and then expanded with other calendars by Maximiliano Taborda, which ended being too complicated from my point of view.

This version is the first one I implemented and presented at ESUG 2005 with some minor changes, renames and improvements like the posibility to evaluate "December/1/2018" and son on.

This version was migrated from the Cuis one.
